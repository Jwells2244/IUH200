"Hello World"

#This is a command that creates a piece of data, specifically a string, created using a string *literal*, which is just any text
# surround by "double quotes" or 'single quotes'

#This command creates a string and returns that string. When a value is returned by a command, that value can be passed
# onto other commands, such as the print function

print("hello world")
#This command creates a string using a string literal, and then passes that string to the print function which then tells the
# python interpreter to display that value in the standard output.

#There are other data types in addition to strings. In particular we can create numbers. We can create numbers using
# literals as well, but numeric literals look different from string literals
257
#This is an integer literal. It creates a value of type int
"257"
#this is a string interger, it creates a value of type str
257 + 12
#this is a command that contains two integer literals then passes those values to the plus operator and then calculates and
#returns the result.

# the percentage is modulus, which is in effect the remainder after a number has been cycled through
# The one slash is a division that ends up with a float, and the double slash is a division that rounds a number like normal code
#, in which it chops off the decimal point
# The // operator is called integer devision
# The / operator is normal division
# The % operator is called modules, it divides and give you the remainder

# The *type* function takes any value, and returns the type of the value
#Types of values:
#Sequence types
#str
#int
#float - If a float is a really small decimal less then one, it will round it to scientific notation
#complex - Includes imaginary numbers

#Every type comes with a special function called a constructor with the same name as type that creates values of that type

#With the round function, every odd number at .5 rounds up, and every even number at .5 rounds down
#.5 rounds to the nearest even integer
# The right formatted strings and floats can be converted to integers using the int() function, or the float() function
# ints and floats can be converted to strings using the str() function

#A variable is a command that can be used to store and retrieve different values after it's been stored within a variable
#We can store and set variables with the = sign
#Variables can be changed mutliple times and hold different values each time
#KEYWORDS can be renamed into variables???
