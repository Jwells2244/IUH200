#Built in types
# Inmutable
#   Int, str, boolean, tuple, NoneType, float, range

# Mutable
#   set, list, dict, fileobject (TextIOWrapper)

#filter, map, function, Exception (IOError, ValueError),


#Sequence: tuples, list, string, range [slices, indexes, concatenation]
#Container: tuple, list, set, string, range, set, dict [len, in]
#iterable: containers, file objects, filter, map object [for loops]


#keywords: not, in, if, for, while, with-as, and, import(from, as), pass, try-except, for-in, lambda, break, def, raise, class,
# continue, del, True, False, None



#General Topics:
#Variables, types, functions, loops, conditionals, sequence operations
#files, errors, recursion, mutability,

#Recursion: numeric recursion, structural recursion, approximation algorithms

#sorting and path-finding algorithms-(breath first, and depth first searches)

#Object oriented programming

#defining classes, encapsulation, and inheritance

#Magic methods: 

#Every operator has a magic method:
# __mul__, __add__, __sub__,__init__(__rmul__, __radd__) etc.
#comparison operators: __gt__, __eq__, __lt__, __le__
#__repr__, __str__

#map function: takes a collection and a function and effectively returns a collection of the results of running the function
#on each thing in the collection

#filter function: takes a collection and a test function that returns a bool and returns a collection of all the things in the
#collection that pass the test

#You can achieve similar effects to map and filter using list comprehensions

#Value vs. Type error
#Type error happens when an object is passed to a function or operator that has a different type than is expected for that
#function or operator

#Value error happens when the types are ok, but there's something about the specific value that's being passed that causes
#the problem, for example int("one"), since int() can take some strings, just not everything
